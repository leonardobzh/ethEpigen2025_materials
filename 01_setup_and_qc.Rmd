## 1.10 Interpretation
The correlation analysis of technical quality control (QC) metrics across all samples, as well as stratified by age group (PND15 pups and adults), provides insight into the consistency and potential confounding variables within the ATAC-seq data.  
Across the entire dataset, several moderate to strong correlations are observed between metrics related to library complexity and sequencing quality. Notably, PBC1 and NRF, which both assess library redundancy, show strong positive correlation as expected, reflecting that higher non-redundant fractions co-occur with reduced PCR bottlenecking. There is also a clear inverse relationship between percent duplicates and NRF/PBC1, confirming that more duplication is associated with lower library complexity.  
In the PND15 subset, correlations largely mirror those of the full dataset but appear slightly weaker overall, possibly due to smaller sample size or more homogeneous technical conditions. Interestingly, TSS enrichment score (a proxy for signal-to-noise) is only modestly correlated with most library metrics, suggesting that chromatin accessibility signal quality is relatively independent of metrics like input concentration or PCR cycles in these samples.  
For adult samples, the same general patterns hold, but correlations between TSS score and both PBC1 and NRF are slightly stronger than in pups. This might suggest that in adult spermatogonial stem cells, overall chromatin signal quality is more tightly linked to library complexity than in early developmental stages.  
These findings emphasize that certain QC metrics—especially duplication rate, NRF, and PBC1—are redundant and tightly coupled, while TSS enrichment, GC content, and RNA concentration vary more independently and may better reflect biological variation or technical noise. These relationships can help guide the choice of covariates in downstream normalization or correction steps, especially if differential accessibility.   
To account for unwanted technical and biological variation during downstream differential accessibility analysis, we plan to apply a Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA) approach. This unsupervised method helps identify latent sources of variation that may or may not be captured by known covariates, providing a robust correction strategy that avoids overfitting to technical metrics alone. This will be especially useful to ensure that observed differences in chromatin accessibility reflect the biological effects of early life stress, rather than residual technical or confounding biases. To evaluate the effectiveness of this correction, we will assess the correlation between principal components of the accessibility matrix (e.g., read counts over peaks) and known covariates before and after applying SVA, which will help determine whether unwanted variation has been reduced without masking  biological signals.
