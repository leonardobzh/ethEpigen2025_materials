This study investigated the impact of early life stress (MSUS) on chromatin accessibility in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) at two developmental stages: postnatal day 15 (PND15) and adulthood—in a mouse model. Our aim was to determine whether early adversity induces persistent epigenomic alterations in male germ cells that could underlie intergenerational transmission.

At PND15, we identified 41 FDR-significant differentially accessible regions between MSUS and control animals. These regions showed enrichment for transcription factor binding motifs associated with immune signaling, cell growth and proliferation (Wingelhofer et al., 2018) (e.g., STAT3, STAT5). After a relaxed selection of the differentially accessible peaks (unadjusted p-value), transcription factor binding motifs associated with germline specification (e.g., DMRT1, DMRT6) and AP-1 motifs (e.g., JUN, FOS) were found to be enriched, suggesting an altered accessibility at regions responsive to developmental or stress-related signals during a critical developmental window. These results align with prior evidence indicating that early life environments can shape the germline epigenome through changes in histone modifications, chromatin state, and non-coding RNAs (Gapp et al., 2014; Bohacek & Mansuy, 2015).

In contrast, no FDR-significant changes were observed in adult SSCs, despite the presence of thousands of regions with nominal differences (p-value < 0.05). This suggests that chromatin accessibility changes induced by early stress may be transient or become epigenetically stabilized in forms not detectable by ATAC-seq in adulthood. Similar dynamics have been proposed in studies of environmental epigenetics, where early perturbations alter epigenetic marks that either fade, reprogram, or selectively persist depending on developmental context and cell type (Skvortsova et al., 2018).

Notably, chromatin accessibility changes at PND15 did not correlate strongly with gene expression in our analysis: there was no overlap between differentially accessible regions and differentially expressed genes.

Functional enrichment analysis further showed that genes near differentially accessible regions at PND15 were associated with developmental and differentiation pathways (with relaxed differentially accessible peak selection). These findings suggest that early life stress reconfigures developmental processes by affecting the regulatory landscape of SSCs, potentially influencing cell fate decisions and germ cell function. Importantly, these effects were only detectable during early development, suggesting that chromatin accessibility changes in SSCs are transient. This raises the possibility that the early-life stress signal is later maintained through other molecular carriers—such as small RNAs, histone modifications, or DNA methylation (Gapp et al., 2014; Rodgers et al., 2015). The absence of persistent changes in adulthood points to potential epigenetic erasure, selection, or compensation over time. Alternatively, long-term effects may be mediated by mechanisms not captured by ATAC-seq, including histone variant retention, 3D genome organization, or the small RNA payload of mature sperm.

In conclusion, early life stress induces significant and biologically coherent changes in chromatin accessibility in SSCs during a sensitive postnatal window. These changes affect key developmental regulators and may reflect a primed but transcriptionally silent state. While no persistent changes were detected in SSCs from adult animals, the early epigenomic shifts observed here support the concept of a responsive and plastic germline epigenome, potentially involved in the initial encoding of environmental experience.

However, several limitations temper this interpretation. The relatively small number of FDR-significant peaks suggests that chromatin changes may be subtle, focal, or highly cell-state specific. The biological impact of these changes—particularly their functional relevance and persistence—remains uncertain. Visual inspection of differentially accessible regions in genome browsers, along with integration of chromatin state and transcriptional data, would help assess their regulatory potential more precisely. Similarly, targeted investigation of the pathways associated with enriched motifs and genes near these peaks may reveal mechanistic links to known developmental or stress-response networks. Finally, although no robust effects were observed in adult SSCs, an exploratory overlap with PND15 data—focused on motif activity, directionality, or chromatin context—could help determine whether any early changes are partially retained or redirected over time.

Altogether, this work highlights that early life adversity can reshape the germline epigenome during a restricted developmental window. Determining whether these transient chromatin changes are relayed to more stable molecular carriers, and whether they influence germ cell function later in life or across generations, remains a critical question for future studies.
